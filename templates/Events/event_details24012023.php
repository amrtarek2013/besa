                            The British Trophy is a football tournament that is organized by BESA between international schools in Egypt since 2014.
                            The tournament is run over 4 days between schools, where a team from each school; whether IGCSE, American Diploma,
                            International Baccalaureate, Canadian International Schools competes against those of other schools and the winning
                            prize involves spending one week in the UK. Each school team consists from 7-9 players and accompanied by a school
                            supervisor, usually the PE teacher. Registration is done through schools, as BESA cannot accept direct applications
                            from individual students who are not accompanied by their school team and PE supervisor.
